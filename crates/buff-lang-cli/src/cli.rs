//! Command-line argument definitions for the `buff` binary.
//!
//! Built on [`clap`] derive. Subcommands supported:
//!
//! - `buff build <FILE>` — compile a `.buff` file to a native executable.
//! - `buff run <FILE> [ARGS]...` — compile and immediately execute, cleaning
//!   up temporary artifacts afterwards.
//! - `buff new <NAME> [--lib|--server|--gpu|--workspace]` — scaffold a new
//!   Buff project in a fresh `<NAME>/` directory. Default (no flag) produces
//!   a runnable binary; the flags select alternative starter layouts (T112).
//! - `buff init` — scaffold a Buff project in the current directory.
//! - `buff fmt <FILE> [--check]` — format a `.buff` file in place (T54).
//!   `--check` exits non-zero without writing when the file isn't already
//!   formatted (mirrors `cargo fmt --check`).
//!
//! Future subcommands (`check`, `lsp`) will be added in later waves.
